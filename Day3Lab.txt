       create a new project - {groupMay23}/Demo1
          initialize with readme file
       create CI/CD pipeline
          edit yml file to delete sleep statements
          commit -> check -> serial execution for stages
                             parallel execution for jobs in a stage
       modify yml file , check logs
            1. change one job to include dir command 
                (just to see files from gitrepo)
            2. change one job to include javac 
                    error 
                    skipping of rest of the stages
