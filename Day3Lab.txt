            image -  (copy from templates)
            script - mvn compile
        run -> successfully
        modify code, create error, watch error messages
        create new issue - assign to yourself, check todolist
        modify code, resolve issue, check resolved issues
    
Lab6 - Check template for your language

Lab5 -  GitLab runner configuration (https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/)
  Download - https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/
  create a folder on c:\gitlab-runner and copy the file
    .\gitlab-runner.exe install
     .\gitlab-runner.exe start
  Browser -> proj1-settings -> ci/cd- > runners -> create new runner -> copy command  ( url and token)
  cmd>  run the command
    -> shell
       Modify toml file to replace pwsh as cmd
browser -> proj1-settings -> ci/cd- > runners -> confirm your runner
- Project -> Settings -> ci/cd-> runners->disable shared runners
      run pipeline -> check messages on local machine

Declared in project config/settings
  settings-> ci/cd -> variables -> new variable -> 1. just protected 2. Masked 3. combination
    create passsword variable and print ($varname)


Lab4 - Variables(in yml)
       create new project in same group
       modify yml file to delete test stage and jobs
       Create a global and a local variable (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/)
       on root level
              variables:
                MY_VAR_G : "A global variable IN ci yml file"
       in job 
              variables:
                  B_JOB_L: "A BUILD job variable local"
       in job script, just print 
              echo "Variables are '$MY_VAR_G' and '$B_JOB_L'"

Lab3 - Artifact for Hello.class

                    - Hello.class
       Run -> Hello.class (in test job, so success)
       check download of artifacts

Lab2 - Modify yml file to create new job in build section, delete 1 job from testing
       modify build job to compile and run java code 
                     build-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
                       stage: build

                         - dir
                         - javac Hello.java
                         - echo "Compile complete."
       run, debug, check logs
       modify testing code to run java file 
              java Hello (Observe error - Hello.class not found)


       public class Hello {
       
       	public static void main(String[] args) {
       		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
       		System.out.println("HelloWorld at 11.05");
       	}
       
       }

Lab1 - GitLab (git)
       create a new group (Oct23)
       create a new project - {groupMay23}/Demo1
          initialize with readme file
       create CI/CD pipeline
          edit yml file to delete sleep statements
          commit -> check -> serial execution for stages
                             parallel execution for jobs in a stage
       modify yml file , check logs
            1. change one job to include dir command 
                (just to see files from gitrepo)
            2. change one job to include javac 
                    error 
                    skipping of rest of the stages
                    logs
