       create new project in same group
       modify yml file to delete test stage and jobs
       Create a global and a local variable (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/)

              echo "Variables are '$MY_VAR_G' and '$B_JOB_L'"

Lab3 - Artifact for Hello.class
       Modify build-job to include artifacts (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/job_artifacts.html)

       Run -> Hello.class (in test job, so success)
       check download of artifacts

Lab2 - Modify yml file to create new job in build section, delete 1 job from testing
       modify build job to compile and run java code 
                     build-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.

       create a new project - {groupMay23}/Demo1
          initialize with readme file
       create CI/CD pipeline
          edit yml file to delete sleep statements
          commit -> check -> serial execution for stages
                             parallel execution for jobs in a stage
       modify yml file , check logs
            1. change one job to include dir command 
                (just to see files from gitrepo)
            2. change one job to include javac 
                    error
